					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was confused when the cosole log gave me "[object, object]" as a result. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think the past Lab made it easier to complete this one because they were similar. 
						Looking at examples, including the instructions, is very helpful for me.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the program execution:</p>
