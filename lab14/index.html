                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>While all of my previous Labs seem to be working fine, there was one that really bothered me because I gave up on it.
                    I went back to Lab 7 and added the box that I wanted so bad. 
                </p>
        </div>

      <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>More than editing the code, I think that what I really wanted to change is the css for several Labs.
                  Anyway, here is the updated version of <a href="../lab7/index.html">Lab 7</a>
