					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p> Poet. Writer. Singer. Filmmaker. Legend. <br>That’s what would be on my description if I was Jim Morrison, but I’m not… </br> 
					<p>My name is April Garnica and I’m a transfer student for Film and Digital Media at UC Santa Cruz. 
						I earned an Associate’s Degree in Film, Television, and Media Arts at Southwestern College and now it’s just hanging on my wall.
						Studying close to the border is so amazing that I had two graduations: one in Chula Vista, CA, and one in Tijuana, BC. 
						I love cats, ajolotes, music, nature, and films.
						It’s been almost a year since I’ve been saying this, but I like Blade Runner so much I dressed up as Pris for Halloween. 
						I grew up and lived in Tijuana most of my life (around 19-20 years), and I recently discovered that I like Mexico City better… 
						Anyway, I’m planning to incorporate my culture into my future films. </p>
