			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this assignment is to pseudocode an everyday task and a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was a bit confusing how and where to type the pseudocode for the game. Also, I couldn't figure
						out how to edit the css. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was feeling insecure about trying something completely new, but I think it went well. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the pseudocode I created with my partner:</p>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<pre id="precode"><code>
//Print the playable area of the game
	//Create a paddle on the left and right
	  //Accept player input for up and down
	//Block player movement within range
	  //Create a ball going left or right
		//Detect if the ball hits the paddle bounce
		//If the ball hits the top or bottom bounce
		//If the ball hits the wall behind the paddle win or lose
						</code></pre>
